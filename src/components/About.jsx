      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I'm <strong>Ian Murigu</strong>, a motivated <strong>Full-Stack Engineer</strong> and <strong>Cybersecurity Enthusiast</strong> originally from Kenya and currently based in Kuwait. 
        I specialize in building secure, scalable, and user-focused  applications using <strong>Django</strong>, <strong>Django REST Framework</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
        My mission is to design solutions that automate workflows, simplify processes, and drive real business impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        My tech journey blends both engineering and cybersecurity. I studied Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics at Meru University 
        of Science and Technology, which gave me a strong foundation in secure systems, digital risk awareness, networking, and system
        architecture. Over time, I deepened these skills through hands-on development, problem-solving, and building real-world projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Professionally, I've worked in roles that required both technical and user-centered thinking. As a Customer Service Coordinator in Dubai,
        I regularly collaborated with developers and IT teams, troubleshot web-based tools, reproduced bugs, and maintained technical documentation.
        This experience strengthened my communication, empathy, and analytical skills — qualities I bring into every product I build today.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've developed full-stack applications featuring authentication (JWT & session-based), role-based access control, CRM integrations (Salesforce, Zoho),
        real-time communication features, and API integrations using tools like Twilio and SendGrid. I'm also comfortable deploying applications using platforms 
        like Render, Vercel, Railway, and working with CI/CD workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond development, I'm passionate about using AI tools to speed up workflows, improve decision-making, and enhance automation. I frequently leverage AI for code
        optimization, data enrichment, API integrations, and building smarter, more efficient features for web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm growing my DevOps skillset, with hands-on experience in Linux, Docker, GitHub Actions, and cloud deployment, and I continue to strengthen my understanding of scalable
        infrastructure.
        Outside of tech, I enjoy reading psychology and business books such as The Psychology of Money and Rich Dad Poor Dad, which help me stay grounded, focused, and growth-oriented.

        I'm currently open to <strong>freelance, remote, or hybrid opportunities</strong> where I can collaborate with passionate teams and continue evolving as both a developer and entrepreneur.
