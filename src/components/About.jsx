        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
        I'm <strong>Ian Murigu</strong>, a passionate <strong>Full-Stack Web Developer</strong> and <strong>Cybersecurity Enthusiast</strong> based in Kenya.
        I specialize in building scalable, secure web applications using technologies like <strong>Django</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>REST APIs</strong>.
        My background working in customer support coordination in Dubai taught me the value of clear communication, problem-solving, 
        and user-focused design.

        <p>
        I began my tech journey studying Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics at Meru University of Science and Technology, and 
        while the course is currently incomplete, it laid a strong foundation in secure systems and digital awareness. 
        I've since continued to learn independently and build real-world projects.
        </p>
        <p>
        Outside of tech, I enjoy reading psychology and business books like <em>The Psychology of Money</em> and <em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em>, which inspire me to grow personally 
        and professionally.I'm currently open to freelance, remote, or hybrid opportunities â€” especially roles that let me create impactful solutions
        and grow as both a developer and entrepreneur.
